# AirFrance
This data analysis covers How Air France can optimize their Search Engine Marketing Strategy.

The dataset is based on the Air France Internet Marketing: Optimizing Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and Kayak Sponsored Search case by the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

The case describes the main challenge that AirFrance is facing is getting their campaigns to be more efficient at driving visitors to their websites and converting them to long-time customers while keeping click costs minimized. Between 2000-2006 the airline industry was suffering from low returns, bankruptcies, and fluctuating demand. That is why the business case is elaborating on multiple ways that AirFrance can increase ROA through SEO and improvement of websites.

The main objective is to find out which advertising strategy/keywords creates more impact on potential clients, which can increase Air France's ROA and net revenues as well as keep costs per click low which is being paid to companies such as Google, Yahoo, Kayak, and Microsoft. A positive outcome to the business case problem would be which keywords should Air France use that will increase profits and simultaneously minimize costs of clicks.
